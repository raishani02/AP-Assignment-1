Q1. 4c
view function in PersonViewer is called through personviewer and call the relevant person's method 
which is passed as parameter. (Run time polimorphism).

Q1. 5e
Disadventages:
1. Case-2: It will need implementation for each and every kind of person explicitly which means do replicate code for every case. 
2. Case-2: Overloading of fuunction explicitly for every kind of Person.
3. Case-1: Run time polymorphism can lead to the performance issue as machine needs to decide which method or 
   variable to invoke so it basically degrades the performances as decisions are taken at run time.

Adventages:
1. (Case-1) Reusability of code for different kind of Person.
2. (Case-2) Easily detect type of Person on compile time.
